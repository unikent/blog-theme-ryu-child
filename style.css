Template: ryu
Description: Ryu Kent is a clutter-free theme for personal bloggers. It has great readability with a large font size, and the one-column layout is perfect for displaying large images. Optional widgets are located at the top panel with social media links and a search field. Background color for an image post will automatically match the uploaded image in the post. This theme is identical to the Ryu theme but has a small tweak to make it work on Kent Uni's rather "unique" infrastructure...
